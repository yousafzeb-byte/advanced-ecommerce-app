npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

This project features a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Vercel:

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The CI workflow automatically runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests:

1. **Code Checkout** - Retrieves latest code
2. **Environment Setup** - Configures Node.js 18
3. **Dependency Installation** - Installs npm packages with caching
4. **Code Linting** - Runs ESLint for code quality
5. **Build Process** - Compiles application with Vite
6. **Test Execution** - Runs all unit and integration tests
7. **Artifact Upload** - Stores build output for debugging

**Pipeline Protection**: The workflow fails if any test fails, preventing deployment of faulty code.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

The CD workflow runs only after successful CI tests:

1. **Code Checkout** - Retrieves verified code
2. **Production Build** - Creates optimized production build
3. **Vercel Deployment** - Deploys to Vercel hosting platform

**Deployment Conditions**:

- Only deploys from `main` branch
- Requires all tests to pass
- Only triggers on direct pushes (not PRs)

### Setting Up CI/CD

For detailed setup instructions, see [CICD_SETUP.md](CICD_SETUP.md).

Quick setup:

1. Connect repository to Vercel
2. Get Vercel credentials (token, org ID, project ID)
3. Add credentials as GitHub Secrets
4. Push to main branch to trigger pipeline

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### React Query Implementation

React Query is used for all data fetching operations:

- Automatic caching and refetching
- Loading and error states management
- Optimized re-renders
- Stale data management

### Redux Toolkit Implementation

Shopping cart state is managed using Redux Toolkit:

- **Reducers**: `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, `updateQuantity`, `clearCart`
- **Selectors**: `selectCartItems`, `selectCartTotal`, `selectCartItemCount`
- **Middleware**: Automatic sessionStorage synchronization

### Session Storage

Cart data persists across browser sessions:

- Cart is saved to sessionStorage on every update
- Cart is loaded from sessionStorage on app initialization
- Survives page refreshes and tab closures (within the same session)

### Firebase Integration

Backend powered by Firebase:

- **Firestore Database** - Product catalog, user data, and orders
- **Firebase Authentication** - User authentication and authorization
- **Real-time Updates** - Live data synchronization
- **Cloud Functions** - Serverless backend logic

## 🎨 Styling

The application features:

- **Dark mode support** with light mode fallback
- **Responsive grid layouts** for product displays
- **Smooth animations** for interactions
- **Modern UI components** with hover effects
- **Mobile-first design** approach

## 🔍 Usage Guide

### Browsing Products

1. View all products on the home page
2. Use the category dropdown to filter by category
3. See product details including ratings and descriptions

### Managing Cart

1. Click "Add to Cart" on any product
2. Navigate to the Cart page using the navigation bar
3. View cart items with quantities and subtotals
4. Remove items using the "Remove" button
5. See real-time updates of total items and total price

### Checkout

1. Click "Proceed to Checkout" in the cart
2. View success message
3. Cart is automatically cleared

## 🚀 Building for Production

### Local Production Build

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

### Deployment to Vercel

The application is automatically deployed to Vercel via GitHub Actions when code is pushed to the `main` branch.

**Manual Deployment:**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Deploy preview
vercel
```
